Keycodes @ JayJo
======

Keycodes is a small application used to grab keyboard and character codes quickly and easily. No one enjoys sifting through lists of text trying to find the one keycode they need.

Keycodes will is an ongoing project. I plan to add in other keyboards and languages, in addition to a number pad and a few other features.

Feel free to fork Keycodes and contribute or leave any comments on how I can improve Keycodes.

Follow me @jayjo on Twitter for updates.

Thanks or stopping by.
